# Credit-Analysis_-Case-Study

We are provided with data of 307511 clients who have applied for loans in application_data excel sheet. We need to analyse and identify the applicants who will for sure repay the loans obtained and identify those, who have chance of defaulting. We need to make sure that applicants who will repay the loan are not rejected so that banks business is not hampered.

We are also provided with previous applications dataset of clients.

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
